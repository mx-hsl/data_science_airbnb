# data_science_airbnb
I made data science training on airbnb data (boston & seattle) and published my insights on a medium blog [post](https://mx-hsl.medium.com/airbnb-data-boston-vs-seattle-a96cf5606d22).
Within the jupyter notebook you can find my analysis code.
Let me know what you think about my [post](https://mx-hsl.medium.com/airbnb-data-boston-vs-seattle-a96cf5606d22).



## Installation

Clone the repository with:
```bash
git clone 
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
```bash

See Running the Notebook for more details.
Now you can open my notebook and get started.
